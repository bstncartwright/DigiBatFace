# DigiBatFace
A custom watchface for my Misfit Vapor.

Displays time digitally on top of eachother in the center, with a circle of ticks going around the edge of the watch to display battery level.

Created because I loved the circle status indicator of the default Misfit Vapor watch face but hated the effect it had on the battery.
